# Mbot-Controller-LineFollower

In this project we implement a speed controller and a line follower program on a Mbot Rapor.
The controller must keep an overshoot smaller than 2%, stationary error at position 0 and a response time as small as possible. The robot will keep its speed constant regardless the angle of climb or descent.
